# A soliloquy of Marc Antony

O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
I committed the file with 2 more lines
Before I realized that he wasn't going to as well.
To to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over they wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
And beg the voice ad utterance of my tongue.
no more coin tosses
